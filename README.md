Created with CodeSandbox
This web app consolidates all of your modern rooming needs! Using Firebase and React we coded a web app that allows you to create suites with users that have the same link. You can chat with your suitemates, view what's in your fridge, manage the suite's grocery list, keep a budgeting spreadsheet, and assign chores.
But alas, 36 hours is such a short amount of time to create a viable product especially with new technologies, so currently The Suite Life is very buggy and requires debugging and much more styling.
In the future, I plan to get a better grasp on React in order to fully create this product.
